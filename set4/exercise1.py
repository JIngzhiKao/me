    In lazyduck.json is a description of a person from https://randomuser.me/

    Return a new dictionary that just has the last name, password, and the
    number you get when you add the postcode to the id-value.
    TIP: Make sure that you add the numbers, not concatinate the strings.
         E.g. 2000 + 3000 = 5000 not 20003000
    TIP: Keep a close eye on the format you get back. JSON is nested, so you
         might need to go deep. E.g to get the name title you would need to:
         data["results"][0]["name"]["title"]
         Look out for the type of brackets. [] means list and {} means
         dictionary, you'll need integer indeces for lists, and named keys for
         dictionaries.
